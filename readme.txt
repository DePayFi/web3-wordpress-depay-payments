== Frequently Asked Questions ==

== What are "Web3 Payments"? ==

Building on the idea that "Web3" is the next generation of a blockchain-based and therefore decentralized Internet, "Web3 payments" are a new type of direct wallet-to-wallet payments that you can receive directly into your own crypto wallet.
Besides being decentralized and peer-to-peer, they are also characterized by being "permissionless" and not requiring you to trust ("trustless") in centralized entities such as intermediaries.
Furthermore, Web3 payments are censorship-resistant. Read more: [What are Web3 Payments?](https://depay.com/web3-payments).

== How does "on-the-fly" conversion work? ==

* You configure which tokens you want to receive (e.g. USDT, BUSD) per blockchain
* Website visitors can make payments with any token they currently have in their wallets (e.g. ETH or any other token)
* DePay's smart contracts auto-converts the payment into the tokens you have configured to be received.
* The payments always arrive directly in your own wallet.
