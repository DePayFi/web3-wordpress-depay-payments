== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are "Web3 payments"? =
Building on the idea that "Web3" is the next generation of a blockchain-based and therefore decentralized Internet, "Web3 payments" are a new type of P2P payments. Besides being decentralized and peer-to-peer, they are also characterized by being "permissionless" and not requiring you to trust ("trustless") in centralized entities such as intermediaries. Furthermore, Web3 payments are censorship-resistant. "Open source" code can often be an indicator of Web3 technologies. Read more: [What are Web3 Payments?](https://depay.com/web3-payments).

= How does "on-the-fly" conversion work? =
* You configure which tokens you want to receive (e.g. USDT, BUSD) per blockchain
* Website visitors can make payments with any token they currently have in their wallets (e.g. ETH or any other token)
* DePay's smart contracts auto-converts the payment into the tokens you have configured to be received.
* The payments always arrive directly in your own wallet.
